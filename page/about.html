		Hi. My name is Darwish Mat Zain and I am 21 years old this year. I am from Kuala Balah, Kelantan, Malaysia. 
		At the moment, I am a computer science student in software engineering at a university in Pahang, Malaysia.
		<br>
		<br>
		I grew up in a regular family in a village in Kuala Balah, Kelantan. When I was born, my mother was a 
		kindergarten teacher while my father was a laborer. I was the eldest child in the family. I have four
		siblings which is three boys and one girl. I went to a kindergarten near my home when I was 4 years old.
		When I was 7 years old, I went to a primary school, a few kilometers away from my home until I was 12.
		In 2013, I went to a highschool near my home but around February I got an offer to a boarding school that 
		is farther away from my home but still within the district. I was reluctant at first but after a talk with
		my aunt, I choose to go the boarding school. I went there until the end of 2017. In 2018, I went to 
		matriculation college until April 2019. In September 2019, I enrolled in bachelor degree of computer science
		in software engineering in a university in Pekan, Pahang and currently I am in my second year here.
		<br>
		<br>
		I am interested in game development and web design. My interest in game development starts when I am 18 years old
		after I finished my highschool. That is when I involve myself in learning programming through Youtube videos.
		Now I run a Youtube channel for my development journey and other stuff that happens along the way.
